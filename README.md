**Free IPTV Playlist**

Enjoy a curated selection of free IPTV channels with automated updates. 
This repository provides a continuously updated M3U8 playlist for easy access to various paid and free channels.

==========================================================================

**Usage**

To utilize this playlist, configure your IPTV player to use the following URL:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IPTVSolutions/IPTV_Online/master/playlists/playlist_all.m3u8

==========================================================================

**Format**

The M3U8 playlist is automatically generated by the make_playlist.py script. This script processes .md files located in the lists directory.

Only channels with URLs that begin with [>] in the URL column are included in the generated playlist.

===========================================================================

**Automated Updates**

The playlist is updated automatically every 30 minutes via an automated action. The update process includes the following:

  **BG TV Channels:** If any tokens have expired, the system will scrape new tokens to ensure continuous availability. This approach minimizes downtime and reduces manual effort.

  **TR TV Channels:** These channels are primarily free and do not require token scraping. They are updated alongside BG TV channels for consistency.

  **Workflow Actions:** Failed workflows occur when the system checks tokens and finds no changes. Once a token is identified as expired and a new one is obtained, the workflow will pass successfully with the updated tokens.

===========================================================================
